📈 Time-Series Forecasting with XGBoost
A robust and modular pipeline for forecasting time series data using XGBoost, a powerful tree-based machine learning algorithm. This project emphasizes practical feature engineering, temporal validation, and production-ready structuring to support real-world deployment and experimentation.

🧠 Goals
Forecast future values in univariate or multivariate time-series data using XGBoost.
Leverage lag features, rolling statistics, and calendar-based patterns.
Provide an end-to-end pipeline from raw data to forecast outputs.
Maintain a clean structure for training, testing, and experimentation.
